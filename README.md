# JS-Challenge-Questions
These a are JS challenge questions. They are designed to be difficult. Some are fairly straightforward whereas others will require you to do some JS gymnastics to complete.
```bash
    npm install -g jest # Install jest globally

    npm install # Install jest html reporter

    jest somefile.spec.js # Execute that file to see if you pass the test cases

    # Afterwards, the results should appear in "test-report.html" and can be viewed in browser
```
